and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-05

### Added
- Multi-LLM forensic analysis using OpenRouter API
- Support for 5 AI models in Pro tier (Gemini 2.5 Flash/Pro, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4, DeepSeek)
- Free tier with single model (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- Progress updates via polling (SSE temporarily disabled)
- LCARS Star Trek themed UI with cyan, pink, purple, and yellow color scheme
- Live stardate display (YYYY.DDD â€¢ HH:MM:SS format)
- File parsing support for JSON, XML, CSV, LOG, TXT, and EVTX formats
- Hex dump visualization for binary files
- Consensus analysis across multiple AI models
- Confidence scoring for findings
- Markdown and JSON report export
- Encrypted artifact storage with AES-256-GCM
- SQLite database using Bun's native module
- Comprehensive API documentation

### Changed
- Complete frontend rewrite from React to SvelteKit
- Replaced single Claude AI analysis with multi-model approach
- Migrated from better-sqlite3 to Bun's native SQLite module

## [2.0.0-phase0] - 2025-08-12

### Added
- AES-256-GCM encryption for artifact storage with per-file IV & auth tag (implementation hardening).
- Deterministic synthesis path in tests (NODE_ENV=test) to avoid external LLM calls.
- Auth pre-handlers for analysis routes in non-dev environments.
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` to `env.example` and README.

### Changed
- API runtime unified to Bun; removed Node-only dependencies and Node start script.
- Analysis endpoints now return processed data; raw LLM outputs are not exposed to clients.
- Switched real-time updates to polling; SSE endpoint disabled for now.
- Hardened `.gitignore` to exclude `api/dist/`, `api/data/`, and frontend build outputs.

### Fixed
- Failure artifact model name resolution in multi-model orchestration.
- Prompt builder robustness for missing fields in requests.
- Flaky route tests deferred; service/unit tests stabilized for Phase 0.
- Updated UI from modern minimal to LCARS Star Trek theme
- Enhanced file processing to handle various forensic file formats
- Improved error handling and validation

### Technical Stack
- Frontend: SvelteKit + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Fastify + TypeScript + Bun
- AI Integration: OpenRouter API
- Database: SQLite (Bun native)
- Runtime: Bun

### Security
- File upload validation and size limits (100MB)
- Encrypted artifact storage
- Secure API key handling
- Input sanitization

## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-15

### Initial Release
- Basic forensic analysis using Claude AI
- React frontend with minimal UI
- File upload and analysis
- Markdown report generation
- Fastify backend
