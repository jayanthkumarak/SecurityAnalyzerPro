# ForensicAnalyzer Pro - Complete Project Context

## Project Genesis & Background

This project was born from a real-world forensic investigation of Intel Driver & Support Assistant (esrv.exe) accessing the LSASS process on a Windows 11 Enterprise system. The investigation demonstrated the power of AI-assisted forensic analysis and revealed the need for a comprehensive platform that combines:

1. **Forensic Artifact Analysis** - Processing complex evidence packages
2. **AI-Powered Intelligence** - Leveraging Claude for expert-level analysis
3. **Threat Intelligence Integration** - Real-time TTP correlation with MITRE ATT&CK
4. **Interactive Education** - Teaching analysts about attack techniques
5. **Professional Reporting** - Executive-ready security assessments

## Real Investigation That Inspired This Project

### Case Study: Intel esrv.exe Investigation
**Investigation ID:** SEC-2025-0704-001  
**System:** Windows 11 Enterprise (Build 22631) - Lenovo ThinkPad  
**Alert:** Intel Driver & Support Assistant accessing LSASS process  
**Investigation Duration:** 7 phases across multiple weeks  

#### Key Artifacts Analyzed:
- **462 Prefetch files** including ESRV.EXE-8C6FE54F.pf and ESRV_SVC.EXE-23809E5E.pf
- **50+ Network connections** with no malicious external communications
- **15+ Intel processes** with proper digital signatures
- **Complete timeline** from system boot to incident occurrence
- **Security Event Log** analysis showing benign LSASS access patterns
- **Registry analysis** confirming legitimate service installation
- **Process tree analysis** validating legitimate parent-child relationships

#### Investigation Methodology Used:
```
Phase 1: Initial reconnaissance and data inventory
Phase 2: Timeline analysis and event correlation  
Phase 3: Process and memory analysis
Phase 4: Network communications analysis
Phase 5: Persistence mechanisms analysis
Phase 6: Lateral movement indicators assessment
Phase 7: Comprehensive reporting and recommendations
```

#### Key Finding: 
**BENIGN** - The esrv.exe process only requested safe LSASS access rights (ReadData, QueryName, ReadControl, SYNCHRONIZE) and explicitly did NOT request dangerous memory reading permissions (PROCESS_VM_READ) required for credential theft.

#### MITRE ATT&CK Correlation:
- **T1003** (OS Credential Dumping) - **NOT DETECTED** due to lack of dangerous access rights
- **T1055** (Process Injection) - **NOT DETECTED** no injection patterns observed
- **T1574** (Hijack Execution Flow) - **NOT DETECTED** legitimate Intel software
- **Overall Assessment:** **NO MITRE ATT&CK techniques detected**

This investigation proved that AI analysis combined with MITRE ATT&CK correlation could provide definitive security assessments while educating analysts on attack techniques.
