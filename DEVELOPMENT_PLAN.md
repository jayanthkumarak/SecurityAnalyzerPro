## Development Model

This plan uses a **session-based development approach** where each session represents ~1 hour of focused collaborative development between the user and Claude Code Assistant.

**Session Structure:**
- **Duration:** ~1 hour per session
- **Scope:** Complete, testable features
- **Deliverables:** Working code + tests + documentation + git commit
- **Context:** Each session builds incrementally on previous work

**Key Advantages:**
- **Realistic Planning** - Accounts for actual development constraints
- **Measurable Progress** - Clear deliverables each session
- **Flexibility** - Can adjust priorities between sessions
- **Continuity** - Documentation ensures smooth handoffs
