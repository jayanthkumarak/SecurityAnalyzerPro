## Context

This plan provides the practical implementation roadmap for SecurityAnalyzer Pro, building upon the existing PRD and Project Plan documents. It focuses on the immediate development phases with Claude Code Assistant as the primary implementation partner.

**Key Differences from Project Plan:**
- **Accelerated timeline** leveraging AI-assisted development
- **Iterative approach** with working prototypes at each phase
- **Single developer + AI** model rather than full team
- **Focus on MVP** with core functionality first
